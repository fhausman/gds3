I've woke up...<br>Pulsating lasers bars stand between me and the exit...
How did I get here?<br>Last I remember is being in my ship, going behind the moon on a research mission...
Everything hurts when I move, how long I've been asleep?<br>I'm still in my suit but it doesn't seem to be fully working...
It doesn't look like there is someone else here besides me...
Huh? That sounds... Explosion caused energy shutdown.<br>This is my chance to get out of here.
Station went completly dark, I'm lost, I don't know where I'm going...
Suddenly, I'm falling...<br>I must have walk into an open shaft...<br>If only gravity boots in the suit were still functional...
